Photographs of individuals can be matched against large databases of criminals so that loss prevention and retail security professionals can be instantly notified when a shopper enters a store that prevents a threat. Face recognition systems are already radically reducing crime. The technology greatly improves the power of surveillance. At the simple end, a facial recognition system connected to a network of cameras can automatically track an individual as they move in and out of coverage, even if no other information is known about them. At the more complex end, a facial recognition system fuelled by a large database of labelled data can enable police to pinpoint a person of interest across a city of networked cameras."
