# An online platform for real time face recognition

## 1. Introduction
Undoubtedly, face recognition does have a very large variety of services and applications, beginning from human identification and surveillance and coming as far as e marketing and advertising for customers. The ability to efficiently recognize individuals through a combination of their facial characteristics (e g their eyes) is certainly an important phenomenon. So, the goal of recognizing peers through their faces is something already apparent on our everyday lives.

In our days, face recognition is more and more utilized in order to search and identify shoplifters, retail criminals, or people with a history of frauds or crimes. This means that their pictures can, after being processed, be matched against a large criminal database. As a result, this can prevent and reduce crime rates by identifying criminals from installed cameras.

## 2. The idea
All existing face recognition approaches can be used, extended and efficiently deployed for a wide variety of application in our everyday lives, ranging from outdoor face recognition for crime detection up to indoor object recognition and pattern matching. This is an extension of the existing facial identification approaches by proposing an online platform/website that can be used from the police forces.

This approach builds upon existing work and suggests not an algorithm, but a complete systemic approach through a crime detection platform to be used in police headquarter/precincts. The platform considers the Haar Cascade algorithm for the facial recognition detection and extends it by performing real-time recognition from the connected cameras in the system.

The platform supports two different types of users:
* Police employees in the headquarters/precincts
* Police Administrators, with a higher level of access and also responsible for database maintenance

The main features of the platform include:
* inserting, editing and deleting user and criminal information
* applying 6 different filters in the livestream cameras (no, gray, sepia, redish, blur, inverted)
* searching for criminals based on their picture through a livestream camera feed and identify them

As for the criminal identification, it is made possible through image pattern recognition between the provided criminalâ€™s image and snapshots of identified faces from the livestream feed.

The Live Feed section offers six different options for video filters, enabling the user to select the best filter, depending on the relevant situation of the physical surroundings (e.g. broad light, dark environment).

## 3. Tools needed

* Project Version : `Final`
* IDE Version : `InteliJ Pycharm 2019.3.3 Community Version`
* Programming Language : `Python`
* Web framework: `Flask`
* Python Version : `3.6.0`
* SQL Version : `MySQL RDBMS (XAMPP)`

## 4. Building the database (MySQL)

The database of the platform consists of 3 different tables, the `users` table, the `criminals` table and the `contact` table.

# 6. Deploying the platform

The steps to deploy the website should be the following:

1. Creating the database
You may login in any MySQL database management panel and create a new database. You may use the `criminal_detection` name for your database. Make sure you select the UTF-8 encoding (collation `utf8_general_ci`). Both `app.py` and `camera.py` files include the following line for a connection to the MySQL database:
`mydb = MySQLdb.connect(db="criminal_detection", host="localhost", user="root", passwd="")`
You may update this according to your localhost setup and credentials.
2. Populating the database
Select your database (e.g. the `criminal_detection`) and import the `criminal_detection.sql` file, which includes the creation of the tables and the data population
3. Running the `app.py` file
This is the main file which includes the necessary app routings towards the HTML pages, alongside with the relevant data processing. The `camera.py` file is only called in the livestream page.
4. That's it! You have successfully deployed the website...
